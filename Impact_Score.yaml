# Impact Score

- score_range: [9, 10]
  description: Major effect on core longevity biomarkers or disease risk. Highly generalizable across patient populations. Often first-line behavior or intervention.
  examples:
    - Starting aerobic activity in sedentary individual
    - Smoking cessation
    - Addressing major sleep deprivation

- score_range: [7, 8]
  description: Strong impact on relevant markers or systems. Benefits are meaningful but may depend on baseline behavior or condition severity.
  examples:
    - Time-restricted eating in someone with elevated HbA1c
    - Daily meditation for elevated cortisol/stress
    - Eliminating processed sugar for insulin resistance

- score_range: [5, 6]
  description: Moderate improvements expected. Often serves as supportive or secondary intervention.
  examples:
    - Swapping butter for olive oil
    - Moderate increase in daily step count
    - Magnesium supplementation for borderline low levels

- score_range: [3, 4]
  description: Mild benefit or smaller-magnitude shifts in secondary biomarkers. More relevant for fine-tuning or in combination with higher-impact changes.
  examples:
    - Drinking more water
    - Using blue light filters at night
    - Adding flaxseed to diet

- score_range: [1, 2]
  description: Minimal direct impact; typically behavioral nudges or quality-of-life suggestions. Rarely prioritized unless part of challenge stacking or patient preference.
  examples:
    - Switching pillow types
    - Gratitude journaling without broader context

- score_range: [0, 0]
  description: No impact or potential harm. Should not appear in recommendation library.
  examples:
    - Deprecated or disproven interventions
