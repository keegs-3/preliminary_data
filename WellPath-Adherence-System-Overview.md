# WellPath Adherence System - Executive Overview

182 unique health recommendations converted to unified algorithmic tracking

## The Challenge

**182 unique health recommendations** with vastly different tracking requirements:

```
"Take metformin daily" → Simple binary: Did they take it? Yes/No

"Get 7-9 hours of sleep on at least 3 nights per week" → Complex: 
- Zone-based evaluation (7-9 hour optimal range)
- Frequency requirements (≥3 nights/week)  
- Multi-day pattern tracking

"Limit ultra-processed foods completely" → Zero tolerance:
- Any violation fails entire week
- Elimination-based scoring
```

**Traditional Approach**: Build 182 custom tracking solutions → Maintenance nightmare  
**Solution**: 10 algorithmic patterns handle recommendation complexity through configuration

## Foundation: Data Architecture

### New Tracked Metrics Structure
**Before**: Rigid, recommendation-specific data points  
**After**: Flexible metric taxonomy supporting any health behavior

```json
{
  "metric_id": "sleep_duration",
  "data_type": "continuous",
  "unit": "hours", 
  "validation_range": [0, 24],
  "tracking_frequency": "daily",
  "aggregation_methods": ["average", "sum", "zones"]
}
```

### Calculated Metrics Engine
Transform raw inputs into trackable metrics:
- **"Sleep time + Wake time"** → `sleep_duration` metric (`wake_time - sleep_time`)
- **"Body weight + Height"** → `bmi_calculated` metric (`body_weight_kg / (height_meters^2)`)
- **"First meal + Last meal times"** → `eating_window_duration` metric (`last_meal_time - first_meal_time`)
- **"Daily protein + Body weight"** → `protein_per_kg` metric (`total_daily_protein_g / body_weight_kg`)

### Screening Compliance Framework
Systematic tracking of medical requirements:
- **Preventive screenings** (mammograms, colonoscopies)
- **Routine monitoring** (A1C, lipid panels)
- **Follow-up compliance** (specialist visits, imaging)

### Unit Standardization System
Consistent measurement across all metrics:
- **Time normalization**: "daily", "weekly", "monthly" → Standard periods
- **Unit conversion**: cups → mL, servings → grams, minutes → hours
- **Cross-metric compatibility**: Enable algorithmic comparison

## Algorithmic Solution: 10 Core Patterns

182 custom solutions replaced by **10 fundamental adherence patterns**:

### 1. **Binary Threshold** - Pass/Fail
```python
"Take medication daily" → 
if taken >= 1: score = 100 else: score = 0
```

### 2. **Minimum Frequency** - "At least X days/week"  
```python
"Exercise ≥30min on ≥3 days/week" →
if successful_days >= 3: score = 100 else: score = 0
```

### 3. **Weekly Elimination** - Zero Tolerance
```python
"No ultra-processed foods" →
if any_day_has_violation: score = 0 else: score = 100
```

### 4. **Proportional** - Gradual Progress
```python
"Work toward 10,000 steps" →
score = (actual_steps / 10000) * 100
```

### 5. **Zone-Based** - Optimal Ranges
```python  
"Sleep 7-9 hours optimally" →
if 7 ≤ hours ≤ 9: score = 100
elif 6 ≤ hours < 7: score = 75
else: score = 25
```

### 6. **Composite Weighted** - Multi-Factor
```python
"Overall fitness" →
score = (exercise × 0.4) + (steps × 0.3) + (sleep × 0.3)
```

### 7. **Sleep Composite** - Advanced Sleep Scoring
```python
"Sleep 7-9 hours with consistent schedule" →
duration_score = zone_score(hours, optimal_7_to_9)
consistency_score = (compliant_nights / 7) * 100
score = (duration_score × 0.55) + (sleep_consistency × 0.225) + (wake_consistency × 0.225)
```

### 8. **Categorical Filter** - Category-Specific (Simplified)
```python
"Swap unhealthy caffeine sources for healthy ones" →
unhealthy_sources = filter(caffeine_data, ["energy_drink", "pre_workout", "high_caffeine_soda"])
if count(unhealthy_sources) <= 0: score = 100
```

### 9. **Constrained Weekly Allowance** - Budget Limits
```python
"≤2 takeout meals/week" →
if weekly_total <= 2: score = 100
else: score = max(0, 100 - (excess × penalty))
```

### 10. **Proportional Frequency Hybrid** - Partial Credit + Frequency ⭐ NEW
```python
"≥6 cups water on ≥2 days/week" →
daily_scores = [(actual/6) * 100 for actual in daily_values]
top_2_scores = sorted(daily_scores, reverse=True)[:2]
score = sum(top_2_scores) / 2
# 4 cups daily = 67% not 0%
```

## Implementation: Configuration-Driven Architecture

### JSON Configuration System
Every recommendation becomes a **standardized JSON configuration**:

```json
{
  "config_id": "SC-MIN-FREQ-EXERCISE_30MIN_3_DAYS",
  "scoring_method": "minimum_frequency",
  "schema": {
    "daily_threshold": 30,
    "required_days": 3,
    "tracked_metrics": ["exercise_duration"],
    "unit": "minutes"
  }
}
```

### Algorithm Selection Intelligence
**Natural Language → Algorithm Type**:
- *"Take daily"* → Binary Threshold
- *"At least X days per week"* → Minimum Frequency  
- *"At least X on at least Y days"* → Proportional Frequency Hybrid ⭐ NEW
- *"Work toward"* → Proportional
- *"Optimal range"* → Zone-Based
- *"Every single day"* → Weekly Elimination

### Scoring Engine Integration
```python
# Load patient's active recommendations
configs = load_patient_configs(patient_id)

# Calculate adherence scores  
for config in configs:
    algorithm = create_algorithm(config)
    score = algorithm.calculate_score(patient_data)
    
# Result: Unified 0-100 scores across all recommendation types
```

## Extensibility

### Current State: 182 Recommendations
- **109 complex patterns** → RECS0001-0035: Implemented and tested (100% success rate)
- **73 additional patterns** → Ready for config generation
- **All patterns validated** → Comprehensive testing framework with 109/109 success rate

### Future State: Challenges System
Same algorithmic foundation, different scale:

**Recommendations** (long-term): *"Exercise 3x/week indefinitely"*  
**Challenges** (time-bound): *"Exercise 3x/week for next 30 days"*

```json
// Challenge configuration (inherits same algorithms)
{
  "config_id": "CHALLENGE-MIN-FREQ-EXERCISE_30_DAYS",
  "scoring_method": "minimum_frequency",  // Same algorithm!
  "duration": "5_days",                  // Challenge-specific
  "streak_bonuses": true,                 // Challenge features
  "schema": {
    "daily_threshold": 30,
    "required_days": 3,
    "tracked_metrics": ["exercise_duration"]
  }
}
```

### Scalability Benefits
