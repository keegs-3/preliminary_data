# WellPath Health Analytics System - Documentation

A comprehensive health assessment pipeline that processes biomarkers, survey responses, and education engagement to generate personalized wellness scores and algorithmic health recommendations.

## üéØ System Overview

WellPath is designed to:
- **Process patient health data** across biomarkers, surveys, and education metrics
- **Score wellness** across 7 evidence-based health pillars using sophisticated algorithms
- **Generate personalized recommendations** with automated algorithm configuration
- **Calculate impact scores** using statistical methods for recommendation effectiveness
- **Provide comprehensive analytics** for health optimization and patient tracking

### Health Pillars Framework
WellPath evaluates health across **7 evidence-based pillars** with intelligent weighting:

| Pillar | Markers % | Survey % | Education % |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Healthful Nutrition** | 72% | 18% | 10% |
| **Movement + Exercise** | 54% | 36% | 10% |
| **Restorative Sleep** | 63% | 27% | 10% |
| **Cognitive Health** | 36% | 54% | 10% |
| **Stress Management** | 27% | 63% | 10% |
| **Connection + Purpose** | 18% | 72% | 10% |
| **Core Care** | 49.5% | 40.5% | 10% |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Processing Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Survey scoring (recommended v2 implementation)
python scripts/wellpath_score_runner_survey_v2.py

# 2. Combined scoring with pillar weights  
python scripts/WellPath_score_runner_combined.py

# 3. Generate individual patient reports
python scripts/Patient_score_breakdown_generator.py
```

### Algorithm Configuration
```python
from src.recommendation_config_generator import process_recommendation

# Generate algorithm from natural language
config, path = process_recommendation(
    "Add one daily serving of fiber-rich food", 
    "REC001"
)
```

## üîß Key Features

### Intelligent Algorithm Selection
- **Binary Threshold**: Pass/fail scoring for strict limits and "eliminate" patterns
- **Proportional**: Partial credit scoring for target achievement
- **Zone-Based**: Tiered scoring for optimal ranges (3-tier or 5-tier)
- **Composite**: Multi-component weighted algorithms
- **Specialized**: Weekly allowances, categorical filters, sleep consistency

### Advanced Survey Logic
- **Personalized targets** based on BMR calculations
- **Multi-pillar impact** for interconnected health factors
- **Complex rollups** for exercise, sleep, and stress patterns
- **Substance use scoring** with quit-time bonuses
- **Biomarker-dependent calculations**

### Comprehensive Analytics
- **4 statistical scaling methods** for impact analysis
- **Patient-level audit trails** showing score derivation
- **Pillar contribution analysis** for targeted interventions
- **Gap analysis** identifying improvement opportunities

## üìä System Outputs
