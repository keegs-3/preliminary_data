# WellPath Survey Scoring System - Unified Architecture Guide

## System Overview

The WellPath survey scoring system uses multiple calculation methods beyond simple response scoring, supporting both straightforward response mapping and sophisticated biomarker-dependent personalized scoring. This system provides clinically meaningful health assessments that account for individual circumstances, medical history, and behavior change over time.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Question ID-Based Architecture**
All custom logic is mapped to specific question IDs (e.g., "2.11", "3.04", "6.07"), making it backend-agnostic and easily integrated with existing database structures.

### 2. **Modular Scoring Functions**
Complex logic is encapsulated in standalone functions that accept standardized inputs, enabling easy porting to any programming language or calling as microservices.

### 3. **Multi-Pillar Impact Logic**
Single questions can appropriately impact multiple health pillars with different weights, reflecting real-world health interconnections.

---

## Scoring Architecture

### Basic Structure
- **Simple Questions**: Have direct `response_scores` mapping (e.g., "Poor" = 0.2, "Excellent" = 1.0)
- **Complex Questions**: Use custom `score_fn` functions that take patient data and return calculated scores
- **Multi-component Questions**: Combine multiple survey responses into single scores

### Score Scaling & Processing
1. **Raw scores > 1 are scaled down**: `score_scaled = score / 10`
2. **Pillar weights are applied**: `weighted_score = score_scaled * pillar_weight`
3. **Multi-pillar distribution**: Single questions can impact multiple health domains

### Pillar Mapping
```python
PILLARS = [
    "Nutrition", "Movement", "Sleep", "Cognitive",
    "Stress", "Connection", "CoreCare"
]

pillar_map = {
    "Nutrition": "Healthful Nutrition",
    "Movement": "Movement + Exercise",
    "Sleep": "Restorative Sleep",
    "Cognitive": "Cognitive Health",
    "Stress": "Stress Management",
    "Connection": "Connection + Purpose",
    "CoreCare": "Core Care",
}
```

---

## Custom Scoring Functions

### 1. **Biomarker-Dependent Personalized Scoring**

#### Protein Intake Scoring (Q2.11)
**Function**: `protein_intake_score(protein_g, weight_lb, age)`

**Clinical Rationale**: Age-adjusted protein requirements based on current nutritional science. Seniors need more protein to maintain muscle mass.

```python
def protein_intake_score(protein_g, weight_lb, age):
    weight_kg = weight_lb / 2.205
    if age < 65:
        target = 1.2 * weight_kg  # Standard adult requirement
    else:
        target = 1.5 * weight_kg  # Higher requirement for seniors
    
    pct = protein_g / target if target else 0
    if pct >= 1: return 10      # Meeting or exceeding target
    elif pct >= 0.8: return 8   # 80% of target (acceptable)
    elif pct >= 0.6: return 6   # 60% of target (needs improvement)
    elif pct > 0: return 4      # Some protein intake
    else: return 0              # No protein reported
```

**Pillar Impact**: Nutrition (6 points), Movement (6 points) - protein supports both dietary goals and muscle maintenance.

**App Display Recommendation**:
```
Current Intake: 45g
Target: 68.2g (Based on your weight and age)
Progress: 66% of target
Score: 6/10
```

#### Calorie Intake Scoring (Q2.62)
**Function**: `calorie_intake_score(calories, weight_lb, age, sex)`

**Clinical Rationale**: Personalized calorie targets using established BMR formulas with sex, age, and weight adjustments.

**Why Personalized Targets Matter**: A 25-year-old male athlete and a 65-year-old female have completely different caloric needs. Generic recommendations ignore crucial individual factors.

```python
def calorie_intake_score(calories, weight_lb, age, sex):
    weight_kg = weight_lb / 2.205
    # Harris-Benedict BMR calculation
    if sex.lower().startswith("m"):
        bmr = 88.362 + (13.397 * weight_kg) + (4.799 * 175) - (5.677 * age)
    else:
        bmr = 447.593 + (9.247 * weight_kg) + (3.098 * 162) - (4.330 * age)
    
    calorie_target = bmr * 1.2  # Sedentary activity multiplier
    pct = calories / target if target else 0
    
    # Optimal range: Â±15% of calculated target
    if 0.85 <= pct <= 1.15: return 10
    elif 0.75 <= pct < 0.85 or 1.15 < pct <= 1.25: return 8
    elif 0.65 <= pct < 0.75 or 1.25 < pct <= 1.35: return 6
    else: return 2
```

**App Display Recommendation**:
```
Current Intake: 1,650 calories
Target: 1,547 calories (Based on your BMR + activity)
Progress: 107% of target (Slightly above optimal)
Score: 10/10 - Excellent intake level
```

### 2. **Multi-Factor Movement Scoring (Q3.04-3.11)**

#### Exercise Type Configuration
```python
movement_questions = {
    "Cardio": {"freq_q": "3.04", "dur_q": "3.08", "pillar_weights": {"Movement": 16}},
    "Strength": {"freq_q": "3.05", "dur_q": "3.09", "pillar_weights": {"Movement": 16}},
    "Flexibility": {"freq_q": "3.06", "dur_q": "3.10", "pillar_weights": {"Movement": 13}},
    "HIIT": {"freq_q": "3.07", "dur_q": "3.11", "pillar_weights": {"Movement": 16}}
}

FREQ_SCORES = {
    "Rarely (a few times a month)": 0.4,
    "Occasionally (1-2 times per week)": 0.6,
    "Regularly (3-4 times per week)": 0.8,
    "Frequently (5 or more times per week)": 1.0
}

DUR_SCORES = {
    "Less than 30 minutes": 0.6,
    "30-45 minutes": 0.8,
    "45-60 minutes": 0.9,
    "More than 60 minutes": 1.0
}
```

#### Composite Scoring Logic
```python
def score_movement_pillar(row, movement_questions):
    for move_type, cfg in movement_questions.items():
        freq_ans = row.get(cfg["freq_q"], "")
        dur_ans = row.get(cfg["dur_q"], "")
        freq = FREQ_SCORES.get(freq_ans, 0.0)
        dur = DUR_SCORES.get(dur_ans, 0.0)
        
        if freq == 0 and dur == 0:
            score = 0
        else:
            total = freq + dur
            if total >= 1.6:  # High frequency + good duration
                score = full_weight
            else:
                score = total * (weight / 2)  # Scaled scoring
```

**Logic Rationale**: 
- Frequency and duration both contribute to exercise effectiveness
- Different exercise types weighted by longevity impact (Strength/Cardio/HIIT > Flexibility)
- Threshold scoring rewards consistent, adequate-duration exercise

**App Display Example**:
```
Cardio Assessment:
Frequency: Regularly (3-4x/week) = 0.8
Duration: 30-45 minutes = 0.8
Combined: 0.8 + 0.8 = 1.6 (exceeds 1.6 threshold)
Score: 16/16 points - Maximum cardio score!
```

### 3. **Complex Sleep Issue Analysis (Q4.12-4.19)**

#### Sleep Issue Configuration
```python
SLEEP_ISSUES = [
    ("Difficulty falling asleep", "4.13", {"Sleep": 5}),
    ("Difficulty staying asleep", "4.14", {"Sleep": 5}),
    ("Waking up too early", "4.15", {"Sleep": 5}),
    ("Frequent nightmares", "4.16", {"Sleep": 3}),
    ("Restless legs", "4.17", {"Sleep": 6, "Movement": 1}),  # Multi-pillar
    ("Snoring", "4.18", {"Sleep": 4, "CoreCare": 2}),
    ("Sleep apnea", "4.19", {"Sleep": 7, "CoreCare": 3}),
]

SLEEP_FREQ_MAP = {
    "Always": 0.2,      # Worst case
    "Frequently": 0.4,
    "Occasionally": 0.6,
    "Rarely": 0.8,
    "": 1.0            # Not selected = full credit
}
```

#### Conditional Scoring Logic
```python
def score_sleep_issues(patient_answers):
    sleep_issues_reported = [x.strip() for x in str(patient_answers.get("4.12", "")).split("|")]
    
    # Full credit if none reported or "None" selected
    if not sleep_issues_reported or any("none" in s.lower() for s in sleep_issues_reported):
        return full_credit_for_all_pillars
    
    # Score each issue based on frequency
    for issue, freq_qid, pillar_weights in SLEEP_ISSUES:
        if issue in sleep_issues_reported:
            freq_ans = str(patient_answers.get(freq_qid, "")).strip()
            multiplier = SLEEP_FREQ_MAP.get(freq_ans, 0.2)
        else:
            multiplier = 1.0  # Not selected = no penalty
        
        for pillar, weight in pillar_weights.items():
            pillar_scores[pillar] += (weight * multiplier)
```

**Logic Rationale**:
- Different sleep issues have different severity (sleep apnea > nightmares)
- Frequency of occurrence affects scoring
- Some issues impact multiple pillars (restless legs affects sleep + movement)
- "None selected" logic prevents penalizing people without issues

#### Sleep Hygiene Protocol Scoring (Q4.07)
```python
def score_sleep_protocols(answer_str):
    protocols = [x.strip() for x in (answer_str or "").split("|")]
    n = len(protocols)
    
    if n >= 7: score = 1.0      # Comprehensive sleep hygiene
    elif n >= 5: score = 0.8    # Good practices
    elif n >= 3: score = 0.6    # Some practices
    elif n >= 1: score = 0.4    # Minimal effort
    else: score = 0.2           # No practices
    
    return round(score * 9.0, 2)  # Weight: 9 points
```

### 4. **Advanced Stress Management Scoring (Q6.01-6.07)**

#### Multi-Question Stress Assessment
```python
def stress_score(stress_level_ans, freq_ans):
    level_map = {
        "No stress": 1.0,
        "Low stress": 0.8,
        "Moderate stress": 0.5,
        "High stress": 0.2,
        "Extreme stress": 0.0,
    }
    freq_map = {
        "Rarely": 1.0,
        "Occasionally": 0.7,
        "Frequently": 0.4,
        "Always": 0.0,
    }
    
    stress_level_score = level_map.get(stress_level_ans, 0.5)
    frequency_score = freq_map.get(freq_ans, 0.5)
    raw_score = (stress_level_score + frequency_score) / 2
    return round(raw_score * 19, 2)  # Scale to pillar weight
```

#### Context-Aware Coping Skills Scoring
```python
COPING_WEIGHTS = {
    "Exercise or physical activity": 1.0,           # Most effective
    "Meditation or mindfulness practices": 1.0,     # Most effective
    "Professional counseling or therapy": 1.0,      # Most effective
    "Deep breathing exercises": 0.7,
    "Hobbies or recreational activities": 0.7,
    "Talking to friends or family": 0.7,
    "Journaling or writing": 0.5,
    "Time management strategies": 0.5,
    "Avoiding stressful situations": 0.3,           # Less effective
    "None": 0.0,
}

def coping_score(answer_str, stress_level_ans, freq_ans):
    responses = [r.strip() for r in str(answer_str or "").split("|")]
    has_none = any("none" in r.lower() for r in responses)
    n_coping = sum([1 for r in responses if r.lower() not in ("none", "")])
    
    # High stress individuals need coping strategies
    high_stress = (stress_level_ans in ["High stress", "Extreme stress"] or
                   freq_ans in ["Frequently", "Always"])
    
    if not n_coping or has_none:
        if high_stress:
            return 0.0  # High stress + no coping = major concern
        else:
            return 5.5  # Low stress + no coping = acceptable
    elif n_coping >= 1:
        return 7.0  # Has coping strategies
```

**Logic Rationale**: 
- Stress assessment considers both intensity and frequency
- Coping strategies weighted by evidence-based effectiveness
- Context-aware: High stress individuals penalized more for lacking coping skills

**App Display Recommendation**:
```
Stress Assessment:
Level: Moderate stress (0.5)
Frequency: Occasionally (0.7)
Combined: (0.5 + 0.7) Ã· 2 = 0.6
Score: 0.6 Ã 19 = 11.4/19 points
```

### 5. **Enhanced Substance Use Scoring (Q8.01-8.38)**

#### Multi-Substance Tracking System
```python
SUBSTANCE_QUESTIONS = {
    "Tobacco": {
        "current_band": "8.02",     # Usage intensity
        "current_years": "8.03",    # Duration of use
        "current_trend": "8.04",    # Increasing/decreasing
        "former_band": "8.22",      # Past usage if quit
        "former_years": "8.21",     # Duration when used
        "time_since_quit": "8.23",  # Time since quitting
    },
    # ... similar for Alcohol, Recreational Drugs, Nicotine, OTC Meds, Other
}

SUBSTANCE_WEIGHTS = {
    "Tobacco": 15,          # Highest impact
    "Alcohol": 10,
    "Recreational Drugs": 8,
    "Nicotine": 4,
    "OTC Meds": 6,
    "Other Substances": 6
}

USE_BAND_SCORES = {
    "Heavy": 0.0,      # Worst health impact
    "Moderate": 0.25,
    "Light": 0.5,
    "Minimal": 0.75,
    "Occasional": 1.0   # Best score for current users
}

DURATION_SCORES = {
    "Less than 1 year": 1.0,      # Short exposure
    "1-2 years": 0.8,
    "3-5 years": 0.6,
    "6-10 years": 0.4,
    "11-20 years": 0.2,
    "More than 20 years": 0.0     # Long exposure = more damage
}
```

#### Enhanced Time-Since-Quit Bonuses
```python
QUIT_TIME_BONUS = {
    "Less than 3 years": 0.0,        # No bonus yet
    "3-5 years": 0.1,                # Small bonus
    "6-10 years": 0.2,               # Moderate bonus  
    "11-20 years": 0.4,              # Large bonus
    "More than 20 years": 0.6        # Maximum bonus
}
```

#### Complex Substance Scoring Logic
```python
def score_substance_use(use_band, years_band, is_current, usage_trend=None, time_since_quit=None):
    band_score = USE_BAND_SCORES.get(use_band, 0.0)
    duration_score = DURATION_SCORES.get(years_band, 0.0)
    base_score = min(band_score, duration_score)  # Worst of both factors
    
    if not is_current:
        # Enhanced: Graduated bonus based on time since quitting
        if time_since_quit:
            quit_bonus = QUIT_TIME_BONUS.get(time_since_quit, 0.15)
        else:
            quit_bonus = 0.15  # Fallback for missing data
        base_score = min(base_score + quit_bonus, 1.0)
    
    if is_current and usage_trend:
        if "more than I used to" in usage_trend:
            base_score = max(base_score - 0.1, 0.0)  # Penalty for increasing
        elif "less than I used to" in usage_trend:
            base_score = min(base_score + 0.1, 1.0)  # Bonus for decreasing
    
    return base_score
```

**Logic Rationale**:
- Tracks 6 different substance categories with different health impacts
- Considers usage intensity, duration, and trends
- Enhanced time-since-quit bonuses reward long-term cessation
- Penalizes heavy/long-term use patterns

**Enhanced App Display Examples**:

**For Long-term Quit (8 years ago)**:
```
ð¯ Tobacco Assessment - Long-term Quit (8 years ago)
Status: Former User
Previous Usage: Heavy use (0.0 base)
Duration Used: 11-20 years (0.2 base)
Base Score: min(0.0, 0.2) = 0.0
Quit Bonus: +0.2 (6-10 years category)
Final Score: min(0.0 + 0.2, 1.0) = 0.2
Weighted Score: 0.2 Ã 15 = 3.0/15 points
Impact: Great improvement from quitting despite heavy past use
```

### 6. **Evidence-Based Screening Compliance (Q10.01-10.08)**

#### Screening Guidelines Database
```python
screen_guidelines = {
    '10.01': 6,     # Dental exam: Every 6 months
    '10.02': 12,    # Skin check: Annual
    '10.03': 12,    # Vision: Annual
    '10.04': 120,   # Colon: Every 10 years (120 months)
    '10.05': 12,    # Mammogram: Annual
    '10.06': 36,    # PAP: Every 3 years
    '10.07': 36,    # DEXA: Every 3 years
    '10.08': 36,    # PSA: Every 3 years
}
```

#### Time-Based Compliance Scoring
```python
def score_date_response(date_str, window_months):
    exam_date = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
    today = datetime.today()
    months_ago = (today.year - exam_date.year) * 12 + (today.month - exam_date.month)
    
    if months_ago <= window_months:
        return 1.0              # Within guidelines
    elif months_ago <= int(window_months * 1.5):
        return 0.6              # Slightly overdue
    else:
        return 0.2              # Significantly overdue
```

**Logic Rationale**: Evidence-based screening intervals with grace periods for scheduling challenges.

### 7. **Cognitive Activity Engagement (Q5.08)**
```python
def score_cognitive_activities(answer_str):
    activities = [x.strip() for x in (answer_str or "").split("|")]
    n = len(activities)
    
    if n >= 5: score = 1.0      # Highly engaged
    elif n == 4: score = 0.8    # Well engaged
    elif n == 3: score = 0.6    # Moderately engaged
    elif n == 2: score = 0.4    # Some engagement
    elif n == 1: score = 0.2    # Minimal engagement
    else: score = 0.0           # No engagement
    
    return round(score * 8.0, 2)  # Weight: 8 points
```

---

## Backend Integration Strategy

### 1. **Database Schema Considerations**

The existing question relations should support:
```sql
-- Question metadata table
questions (
    id VARCHAR,  -- "2.11", "3.04", etc.
    scoring_type ENUM('simple', 'custom_function', 'multi_factor'),
    requires_biomarkers BOOLEAN,
    dependent_questions JSON  -- For multi-question logic
)

-- Scoring parameters table  
question_scoring (
    question_id VARCHAR,
    pillar VARCHAR,
    weight DECIMAL,
    response_value VARCHAR,
    score_value DECIMAL
)
```

### 2. **API Design Pattern**

```javascript
// Scoring service endpoint
POST /api/scoring/calculate-survey-scores
{
    "patient_id": "123",
    "responses": {
        "2.11": "85",  // protein grams
        "3.04": "Regularly (3-4 times per week)"
    },
    "biomarkers": {  // For biomarker-dependent questions
        "weight_lb": 150,
        "age": 35,
        "sex": "female"
    }
}
```

### 3. **Scoring Engine Architecture**

```python
class SurveyScorer:
    def __init__(self, question_config, biomarker_data):
        self.config = question_config
        self.biomarkers = biomarker_data
    
    def score_question(self, question_id, response):
        config = self.config[question_id]
        
        if config.get('score_fn'):
            # Custom function scoring
            return self._call_custom_function(config['score_fn'], response)
        else:
            # Simple response mapping
            return config['response_scores'].get(response, 0)
    
    def _call_custom_function(self, func_name, response):
        # Route to appropriate custom scoring function
        # Can be local functions, microservices, or external APIs
```

### 4. **Configuration Management**

The scoring logic is highly configurable through the question mapping structure:

```python
"2.11": {
    "pillar_weights": {"Nutrition": 6, "Movement": 6},  # Multi-pillar impact
    "score_fn": "protein_intake_score",                  # Custom function name
    "requires": ["weight_lb", "age"]                     # Required biomarker fields
}
```

This allows the backend to:
- Dynamically load scoring configurations
- Update scoring weights without code changes  
- A/B test different scoring algorithms
- Maintain audit trails of scoring logic changes

---

## Migration Path from Current Python

### Phase 1: API Wrapper
Wrap existing Python logic as REST APIs that the backend can call

### Phase 2: Function Translation  
Port individual scoring functions to the backend language (Node.js, Java, etc.)

### Phase 3: Native Integration
Fully integrate logic into the existing scoring service architecture

---

## Key Benefits for Backend Integration

1. **Question ID Mapping**: Seamless integration with existing question relations
2. **Modular Functions**: Each scoring algorithm is self-contained
3. **Language Agnostic**: Logic can be ported to any backend technology
4. **Incremental Migration**: Can implement custom scoring gradually by question ID
5. **Testable**: Each function has clear inputs/outputs for unit testing
6. **Clinically Meaningful**: Sophisticated health scoring logic that provides personalized, evidence-based assessments
7. **Multi-Pillar Impact**: Reflects real-world health interconnections

---

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Map existing question IDs** to the custom logic requirements
2. **Identify biomarker dependencies** for questions requiring patient data
3. **Choose integration approach** (API wrapper vs. native implementation)
4. **Set up scoring configuration** management in your backend
5. **Implement incremental migration** starting with highest-impact custom logic

The architecture is designed to be flexible and backend-agnostic while preserving the sophisticated health scoring logic that makes WellPath's assessments clinically meaningful and personally relevant to each user's unique health profile.
